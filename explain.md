SRB is an 8 vs 8 version of ground RB with a few other changes.

```
- You only get 1 spawn in SRB. No respawning.
- Each team can spawn a maximum of 4 aircraft.
- Only bomber aircraft get air spawns. This makes bombers very powerful.
- Ground units can only detect friendly aircraft within 1 kilometer, and vice versa.
```
