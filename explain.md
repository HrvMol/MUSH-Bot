SRB is an 8 vs 8 version of ground RB with a few other changes.

- You only get 1 spawn in SRB. No respawning.
- Each team can spawn a maximum of 4 aircraft.
- Ground units can only detect friendly aircraft within 1 kilometer, and vice versa.
- Each match lasts 25 minutes similar to a normal match.
- When playing SRB we use the SRB voice chat to communicate
- Only bombers get air spawns, this makes them powerful. This does NOT include strike aircraft
